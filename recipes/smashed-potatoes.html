    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <uo>
        <li>1 lb Potatoes (Note: any size can work and you may just need to cut them differently)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt (for boiling)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt (for sprinkling)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Old Bay Seasoning, optional garnish (but do it)</li>
      </uo>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook potatoes: Bring a pot of water to the boil, add 1 tbsp salt. Cook potatoes until soft AKA Fork Tender.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 390Â°F.</li>
        <li>Steam dry: Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Smashing Time. Place on the tray then use a large fork, keeping them in one piece. Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch!</li>
        <li>Steam dry again: Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes to aid in making them crispier.</li>
        <li>Party Time: Drizzle with butter, then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well as Old Bay if using.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake for 45 minutes to 55 minutes or until deep golden and crispy. Do not flip.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, sprinkled with additional if desired.</li>
      </ol>
