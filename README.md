Working Project for TOP: Odin-Recipes

The objective of this project is to create a recipe website with an emphasis on the HTML as CSS skills will be learned later in the TOP Curriculum. I expect to utilize the following HTML Elements/Skills:

  -Boilerplate Setup
  -<a href=""> </a>
  -<img src="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer>
  -<ul>
    <li>
  -<ol>
    <li>
  -<strong>
  -<em>

Today is 5/22/2024 and I would like to see how I feel about the above following the project so I will plan to keep notes below.
