  -Boilerplate Setup

  -Anchor html element 

  -Image html element

  -Unordered html element (ul)

  -Ordered html element (ol)

  -Strong html element

  -Emphasis html element

Today is 5/22/2024 and I would like to see how I feel about the above following the project so I will plan to keep notes below.

Today is 5/24/24 and I am pleased with the outcome of my project as I am feeling much more comfortable with html and git. I did review other submissions and some of them are really quite stellar. I am excited to learn CSS so I can really make the webpage start coming to life with some style and color.
